    <h3>13th of November 2009 - Release of version 0.9.18</h3>

    <p>After a very long investigation resulting in somewhat a better
    understanding of licensing issues, logback is now <a
    href="license.html">dual-licensed</a> under the EPL 1.0 and LGPL
    2.1.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed Private-Package and Export-Package sections in
    logback-classic.jar MANIFEST as reported in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-165">LBCLASSIC-165</a>
    by applying the relavant patch supplied by Hugues Malphettes.
    </p>

    <p>JaninoEventEvaluator now passes the throwable associated with
    an event as a <code>java.lang.Throwable</code> instead of an
    <code>IThrowableProxy</code>. This fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-155">LBCLASSIC-155</a>
    as reported by Hontv&aacute;ri J&oacute;zsef. See <a
    href="manual/filters.html#evalutatorFilter">EvaluatorFilter
    documentation</a> for more details.</p>

    <hr width="80%" align="center" />

    <h3>9th of August 2009 - Release of version 0.9.17</h3>

    <p><code>PackagingDataCalculator</code> now correctly deals with
    <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> thrown by class loaders. This
    fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-125">LBCLASSIC-125</a>
    reported by Roland Klein and independently by Didier Besset.
    </p>

    <p>In configuration files, all tags names associated with explicit
    actions are now case-insensitive. This should diminish
    case-related errors users may make when writing configuration
    files. Tag names associated with implicit actions which are
    closely linked to the actual Java class being configured, still
    need to follow the camelCase convention. If you are unsure which
    case to use for a given tag name, just follow the camelCase
    convention for tag names which should be correct in most
    cases. </p>

    <p>It is now possible to create <a
    href="manual/appenders.html#uniquelyNamed">uniquely named files by
    timestamp</a>. Such files are appropriate for log files associated
    with batch applications. This enhancement fulfills <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-91">LBCORE-91</a> as
    requested by Rick Beton and Szel Zoltan.
    </p>

    <p>Append mode is now mandatory in
    <code>RollingFileAppender</code>. This was already the default and
    truncation mode is unreasonable in most cases. For example, in
    truncate mode when an application stops and is quickly re-started,
    any pre-existing log file for the current period will be lost.</p>

    <p>The <code>activeFile</code> field in
    <code>RollingFileAppender</code> is now properly updated, fixing
    <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-90">LBCORE-90</a> as
    reported by Valery Shorin.</p>


    <p>The <code>TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy</code> has been heavily
    refactored. It is now possible to trigger rolling simultaenously
    by <a href="manual/appenders.html#SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP">time and
    by size</a>, fixing <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-61">LBCORE-61</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-145">LBCLASSIC-145</a>
    reported by Joern Huxhorn. The <code>LoggingEventVO</code> class
    now correctly populates its callerData field if the original
    <code>ILoggingEvent</code> already has it.</p>

    <hr width="80%" align="center" />

    <h3>15th of July 2009 - Release of version 0.9.16</h3>

    <p>In addition to nifty new features, this release contains
    several important internal changes. Given the importance of some
    of those internal changes, <em>this release may be less stable
    than previous logback releases</em>.</p>

    <p>In logback-classic, <a
    href="xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/LoggingEvent.html"><code>LoggingEvent</code></a>
    now implements the <a
    href="xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/ILoggingEvent.html"><code>ILoggingEvent</code></a>
    interface. All logback-classic components expect to process
    <code>ILoggingEvent</code> instances. Moreover, events which sent
    to a remote host are now of type <a
    href="xref/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/LoggingEventVO.html"><code>LoggingEventVO</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>Logback-classic will now <a
    href="manual/configuration.html#autoScan">automatically
    re-configure itself</a> when its configuration file is
    modified. This enhancement was requested in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-59">LBCORE-59</a> by
    Michael Osipov.</p>

    <p>FileAppender and its derived class RolllingFileAppender are now
    based on a finer-grain synchronization model. This change is aimed
    at reducing various synchronization related bugs, namely <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-135">LBCLASSIC-135</a>
    and its various sub-tasks.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed a bug in the localLevelReset() method in the
    <code>Logger</code> class which inadvertently used the DEBUG_INT
    value in the org.slf4j.spi.LocationAwareLogger interface instead
    of the DEBUG_INT value in ch.qos.logback.classic.Level class. The
    issue was first identified by Andy Ruch <a
    href="http://qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2009-February/000955.html">in
    a message</a> to the logback-user list
    </p>

    <p>If the logger name had 12 or more segments, a the logger
    conversion specified would throw an
    <code>ArrayIndexOfBounds</code> exception. Lukas Zapletal has
    kindly reported this problem in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-110">LBCLASSIC-110</a>
    and provided a test case.
    </p>

    <p>A new discriminator class called "ContextBasedDiscriminator"
    allows SiftingAppender to separate logging based on the context
    name. This fits nicely with the requirements expressed in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-117">LBCLASSIC-117</a>
    by Rick Janda.
    </p>
    
    <p>When a context is reset, then its object and property maps are
    now cleared. This fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-104">LBCORE-104</a>
    reported by Johan Bos.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-105">LBCORE-105</a>. Configuration
    files placed in jar files will no longer lock the jar file. This
    issue was initially reported for log4j in <a
    href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47465">bug
    47465</a> Mark Thomas.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-94">LBCORE-94</a>. While
    configuring a RollingFileAppender, if the File property is
    declared after any rolling or triggering policies, then logback will
    now generate an error status message.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-134">LBCLASSIC-134</a>
    reported by Darryl Smith. <code>DuplicateMessageFilter</code> will
    now behave correctly when invoked via
    <code>Logger.isXXXEnabled</code> methods.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-107">LBCORE-107</a>,
    incorrectly set context information for the
    <code>NestedBasicPropertyIA</code> instance in Joran, reported by 
    L&oacute;r&aacute;nt Pint&eacute;r.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-109">LBCLASSIC-109</a>,
    reported by Andrew Ruch when a logger context was reset, the trace
    level was erroneously enabled.
    </p>

    <hr width="80%" align="center" />

    <h3>12th of February 2009 - Release of version 0.9.15</h3>

    <p>When the reset() method in <code>LoggerContext</code> is
    called, registered turbo filters are first stopped before being
    unregistered. This fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-89">LBCLASSIC-89</a>
    reported by Alexis Morillo.
    </p>

    <p>Added a servlet for viewing internal status messages as an HTML
    table. Two separate implementations are available; one for <a
    href="manual/configuration.html#viewingStatusMessages">logback-classic</a>
    and the other for <a
    href="access.html#viewingStatusMessages">logback-access</a>.</p>

    <p>Added the <code>clear()</code> mthod to the
    <code>StatusManager</code> interface. After reconfiguration, it
    may be desirable to clear the status list maintained by a
    <code>StatusManager</code>. This change was requested by Alexis
    Morillo in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-77">LBCORE-77</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed problem <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-104">LBCLASSIC-104</a>
    related to loss of MDC information in deferred logging events.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed issue <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-101">LBCLASSIC-101</a>. Logback
    jar files now include full OSGi bundle information in their
    manifests. This information is automatically added by Apache
    Felix' Maven bundle plug-in. The generated manifest files contain
    an appropriate Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment directive,
    fixing <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-8">LBGENERAL-8</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The setter and getter methods for the layout property in
    <code>AppenderBase</code> class now have reasonable default
    implementations, instead of nop previously. This change was
    requested by Thilo Tanner in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-56">LBCORE-56</a>.
    </p>
    

    <p>Added <em>log4j.dtd</em> compatible <a
    href="manual/layouts.html#log4jXMLLayout"><code>XMLLayout</code></a>
    as requested in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-22">LBCLASSIC-22</a>.
    </p>

    <p>New chapter <a href="manual/onJoran.html">on Joran</a>.</p>

    <hr width="80%" align="center" />

    <h3>29th of December 2008 - Release of version 0.9.14</h3>

    <p>Corrected a serious dead-lock problem occuring during
    configuration. It was reported in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-81">LBCLASSIC-81</a> by
    Holger Mense.</p>

    <p>Corrected thread leakage observed with
    <code>TimeBasedRollingPolicy</code>'s
    <code>AsynchronousCompressor</code>. This bug was reported in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-78">LBCORE-78</a> by Szel
    Zoltan.</p>

    <p>Added <a
    href="manual/filters.html#DuplicateMessageFilter">DuplicateMessageFilter</a>,
    a turbo filter which detects duplicate messages, and beyond a
    certain number of repetitions, drops repeated messages.</p>

    <p>Added a new appender called <a
    href="manual/appenders.html#SiftingAppender"><code>SiftingAppender</code></a>. As
    its name intimates, a <code><code>SiftingAppender</code></code>
    can be used to separate (or sift) logging according to a given
    runtime attribute. For example, <code>SiftingAppender</code> can
    separate logging events according to user sessions, so that the
    logs generated by each user go into distinct log files, one log
    file per user.
    </p>
    
    <p><code>BasicStatusManager</code>'s internal buffer is now split
    into two parts, the header part and the tail part. The header part
    stores the fist H status messages whereas the tail part stores the
    last T messages. At present time H=T=150, although these values may
    change in future releases.</p>

    <p>Fixed <code>NullPointerException</code> thrown when calling
    <code>setContextMap</code> on a fresh MDC. <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-98">Issue was</a>
    reported by Francois Terrier.
    </p>


    <p>Evaluators are now wired into an appender automatically
    (implicit rules) without the help of
    <code>EvaluatorAction</code>. EvaluatorAction is now only needed
    for global evaluator elements.  It follows that name attribute is
    necessary only for global evaluators. Embedded evaluators no
    longer need a name. This change fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-100">LBCLASSIC-100</a>. In
    addition, <code>EvaluatorAction</code> has been modified to accept
    evaluators of any type and not just instances of
    <code>JaninoEvaluator</code>.    
    </p>

    <p>Logback-classic default configuration process will now
    automatically print status data on the console in case of warnings
    as well as errors. Previously, status data was printed only in
    case of errors.</p>

    <p><code>ContextInitializer</code> will now print the url of the
    configuration it is using. This should help reduce confusion when
    multiple config files are found on the class path.  This change
    resolves <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-55">LBCLASSIC-55</a>
    reported by Anton Tagunov and Henric Larsson.
    </p>

    <p>In case multiple configuration files are found on the class
    path, <code>ContextInitializer</code> will now emit a
    warning. This fixes <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-85">LBCLASSIC-85</a>
    filed by Szel Zoltan.
    </p>

    <p><code>HTMLLayout</code> now honors custom conversion words,
    thus fixing <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-74">LBCORE-74</a> as
    reported by Natan Cox.</p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-69">LBCORE-69</a> as
    reported by Andrey Rybin. <code>SMTPAppenderBase</code> now has
    support for charset encodings so that email messages can contain
    characters beyond US-ASCII.
    </p>

    <p><code>SMTPAppender</code> in logback-classic now defaults to
    <code>OnErrorEvaluator</code> instead of a janino-based
    evaluator. Thus, by default <code>SMTPAppender</code> no longer
    depends on Janino.</p>

    <p>Added UnsynchronizedAppenderBase class based on Ralph Goers'
    contribution in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-58">LBCORE-58</a>. Note
    that <code>AppenderBase</code> remains unchanged. Appenders which
    need to handle synchronization on their own can do so by deriving
    from <code>UnsynchronizedAppenderBase</code>.</p>

    <h3>5th of December 2008 - Release of version 0.9.13</h3>

    <p>A <code>NullPointerException</code> was being thrown when a the
    level of a logger was set to null. The logger in question had to
    have children. This problem was reported in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-91">LBCLASSIC-91</a>
    by Mateusz Jedruch.
    </p>

    <h3>4th of December 2008 - Release of version 0.9.12</h3>
    
    <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-26">bug
    LBCORE-26</a> reported by Tsutomu YANO and independently by
    Hontv&aacute;ri J&oacute;zsef and Gamaliel
    Amaudruz. <code>RollingFileAppender</code> when used in conjunction
    with <code>DateBasedRollingPolicy</code> will rollover existing log
    files at initialization if their timestamp warrants it.
    </p>

    <p>Added support for file appending in <a
    href="manual/appenders.html#prudent">prudent mode</a>. Thus,
    multiple <code>FileAppender</code> instances running on multiple
    JVMs can safely write to the same log file. With certain
    limitations, prudent mode extends to
    <code>RollingFileAppender</code>.
    </p>


    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-83">LBCLASSIC-83</a>.
    It is now possible to set the level of a logger to null, even if
    it was previously set to a non-null level. Previously, a
    <code>NullPointerException</code> would be thrown.
    </p>

    <p>In reponse to <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-61">LBCLASSIC-61</a>, <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-33">LBCLASSIC-33</a>, <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-14">LBCLASSIC-24</a> and
    <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-24">LBCLASSIC-14</a>
    <code>JMXConfigurator</code> has been redesigned.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-22">LBGENERAL-22</a>. The
    <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/translator/">log4j.properties
    translator</a> web-application has been significatnly refactored.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed improvement request <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-59">LBCLASSIC-59</a>
    relation to StatusListeners, originally submitted by Anton Tagunov.
    </p>

    <p>The logger and class name converters now consider zero as
    having special meaning, and will return the simple class name,
    removing the package name prefix. This feature was asked by
    Silvano Maffeis.</p>
    
    <p>In response to <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-54"> LBCLASSIC-54</a>
    support for turbo filters has refactored. The present code is safe
    under concurrent access while still offering good performance.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-43">LBCORE-43</a> reported
    by Bruno Navert. Configuration files can now look up property
    files from classpath resources.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-86">LBCLASSIC-86</a>
    related to <code>AccessControlException</code> thrown when run in
    a JVM with a <code>SecurityManager</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Invoking the <code>LoggerContext.reset()</code> method resets
    logger levels to their default value, that is <code>DEBUG</code>
    for the root logger and <code>null</code> for all other
    loggers. This was requested in <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-90">LBCLASSIC-90</a> by
    Mateusz Jedruch.
    </p>

    <!-- ======================== minor ================== -->

    <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-69">bug
    LBCLASSIC-69</a> reported by Anton Tagunov. The
    LevelToSyslogSeverity now correctly handles the TRACE level.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-57">bug
    LBCLASSIC-57</a> reported by Anton Tagunov. SyslogAppender could
    overwhelm the Syslog server with very large messages. SyslogAppender
    now limits its message size to 256K.
    </p>

    <p>Logback now supports <a
    href="manual/configuration.html#contextName">setting the logger context
    name</a> as well as inserting variables <a
    href="manual/configuration.html#insertFromJNDI">stored in JNDI</a> as
    properties.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed issue <a
    href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-49">LBCLASSIC-49</a>
    reported by Oliver Lietz. The getLogger() method in
    <code>LoggerContext</code> class will now throw an
    <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> when invoked with a null
    argument.
    </p>


  <hr width="80%" align="center" />

  <h3>28th of October 2008 - Release of version 0.9.11</h3>

  <p>Fixed <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-77">LBCLASSIC-77</a>
  reported independenly by Gianni Doe, Yannick Haudry and Yossi Shaul.
  The childValue() method of <code>CopyOnInheritThreadLocal</code>
  class part of MDC code no longer throws a
  <code>NullPointerException</code>.
  </p>

  <hr width="80%" align="center" />

  <h3>27th of October 2008 - Release of version 0.9.10</h3>

  <p>In case of errors during initialization, logback-classic now
  <em>automatically</em> prints out its internal status. This has been
  a frequently requested feature.
  </p>

  <p>The LogbackValve in logback-access (ensuring integration with
  Tomcat), will now systematically print its internal status upon
  initialization, unless told to be quiet. This greatly helps
  troubleshooting the configration of logback-access under Tomcat.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=147">bug
  147</a> which occured when the user inadvertently attempted to set
  the layout of a <code>SyslogAppender</code>.  The code now actively
  prevents this. Documenation has been updated to reflect the change.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-56">bug
  LBCLASSIC-56</a> originally reported by Michel Colette. Backslash
  characters are now correctly interpreted in filename patterns.
  </p>

  <p>The TurboFilterChain in a LoggerContext is <a
  href="http://svn.qos.ch/viewvc?view=rev&amp;revision=1678">now
  cleared</a> when the <code>reset</code>() method is called. This
  problem was reported on May 1st, 2008, by Julia Hu on the logback
  developpers list.
  </p>

  <!-- ========================== LB CORE ================== -->

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-48">LBCORE-48</a>.  During
  rollover, compression of large files would bring all logging to a
  halt. In this latest release, the rolled over file is first renamed,
  which is a relatively fast operation, and only then is the renamed
  file compressed asyncronously (in a separate thread).

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-11">LBCORE-11</a>.  It is now
  possible to instruct TimeBasedRollingPolicy to delete old files,
  thus controlling then number of archived log files.</p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-42">LBCORE-42</a>. If the
  parent directory of the log file does not exist, then FileAppender
  will create it, including any necessary but nonexistent parent
  directories.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-15">LBCORE-15</a>
  reported by Klaus Unger and others. DBAppender should now work with
  Oracle 9, 10g and 11g, regardless of the JDBC driver type used.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-17">LBCORE-17</a> reported by
  Thorbj&oslash;rn Ravn Andersen. Logback now relies on Geronimo JMS
  API specifications instead of Sun's JMS API specification, the
  latter requiring manual installation. With Geronimo JMS, logback can
  be built using Maven without needing to manually install any
  dependencies.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-23">LBCORE-23</a>. In
  PatternLayout, parenthesis can be used to group conversion
  patterns. It follows that the '(' and ')' carry special meaning and
  need to be escaped to be used as literals. This is now properly
  documented.
  </p>

  <p>The location of the default configuration file can be specified
  by a system property. This feature was requested in <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-32">LBCORE-32</a> by Ted
  Graham, Matt Fowles, Ivan Biddles and Ralph Goers.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCORE-55">LBCORE-55</a> reported by
  Natan Cox. <code>WriterAppender</code> now outputs its presentation
  footer and file footer in the the correct order.

  <!-- ========================== LB CLASSIC ================== -->

  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-67">LBCLASSIC-67</a>
  reported by Alessandro Fustini. SMTPAppender now correctly
  configures the layout used to format the subject line of the
  outgoing email. It no longer appends a lengthy stack trace to the
  subject line.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-68">LBCLASSIC-68</a>
  reported by Gili Tzabari. In environments where the TCCL (Thread
  Context Class Laoder) was not set, logback was unable to located its
  default configuraiton files. Logback now uses the class loader that
  loaded logback itself to locate its resources instead of the
  TCCL. This approach is simpler and deemed to cover more
  environments, i.e. more widely applicable.
  </p>


  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBGENERAL-24">LBGENERAL-24</a>
  reported by Hung Tang. SMTPAppender now supports plain
  username/password authentication as well as both the STARTTLS
  command and SSL connections.
  </p>

 
  <p>Fixed issue <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-48">LBCLASSIC-48</a>
  reported by Peter Royal. SyslogAppender now correctly outputs hours
  as 0-23 and not as 1-12 as previously.
  </p>

  <p>Added a new TurboFilter called DynamicThresholdFilter which can
  filter events depending on MDC values based on a variery of criteria
  such as company name, product or the end user. This filter was
  contributed by Ralph Goers in <a
  href="http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LBCLASSIC-53">LBCLASSIC-53</a>.

  <hr width="80%" align="center" />
 


  <h3>26th of March 2008 - Release of version 0.9.9</h3>
  
  <p>MDC data in now inherited by child threads. This behaviour was
  already specified in the javadocs. The issue was raised by Martin
  Benda in <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=64">bug
  64</a> and independently by Peter Huber.
  </p>
  
  <p>Logback no longer includes retro-weaver generted jars for JDK
  1.4. There seemes to be little interest in JDK 1.4 builds. Calling
  retro-weaver increases logback's build time by a few seconds each
  time &ndash; seconds in which we can do more productive things.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=104">bug
  104</a>, silly but but nonetheless serious copy-and-paste errors in
  the c.q.l.classic.Logger class, reported by Joern Huxhorn.
  </p>

  <p>Having been replaced by <code>SimpleSocketServer</code>, the
  <code>SocketServer</code> class has been removed.
  </p>
  
  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=105">bug
  105</a>, sockets created by <code>SocketAppenderBase</code> is now
  closed, reported by Joern Huxhorn. More generally,
  <code>SimpleSocketServer</code> is much more careful to track open
  client connections and to close them.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=110">bug
  110</a> in relation with the <code>requestParameterMap</code> field
  in <code>AccessEvent</code> - reported by Joern Huxhorn.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66">
  SLF4J bug 66</a> in relation with caller data when using
  log4j-over-slf4j - reported by Frnack Routier.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=129">bug
  129</a> reported by Michael Franz. As a result, Joran now supports
  nested as well as multiple file inclusions.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=100">bug
  100</a> reported by Joern Huxhorn. At serialization time, object
  array passed as parameter, when the LoggingEvent is are now
  serialized as strings.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=109">bug
  109</a> reported by Joern Huxhorn. There should no longer be any
  NullPointerExceptions thrown by deserialized
  <code>AccessEvent</code> instances.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=8">bug
  8</a> reported by Sebastien Pennec. The documentation has been
  updated to reflect the fact that that in the context of conversion
  patterns the percent sign carries special meaning, in order to
  include the percent sign as a literal, it must be escaped with a
  backslash.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=52">bug
  52</a> reported by Kenichi Masuko. The bug has been fixed on March
  8th, 2007. Starting with this release, Joran will support the
  injection of any enum tpye, not just <code>FilterReply</code>.

  <h3>22th of August 2007 - Release of version 0.9.8</h3>
  
  <p>This version of logback synchronizes with SLF4J version 1.4.3. In
  particular, logback now natively supports SLF4J's MDC API introduced
  in SLF4J version 1.4.1. If you are using SLF4J version 1.4.1 or
  later please make sure upgrade to logback version 0.9.8 or later.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed a number of documentation related bugs, in particular <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90">bug 90</a> reported
  by Luc Maisonobe and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=90">bug 88</a> reported
  by Sebastian Davids.
  </p>

  <p>It is now possible to include configuration file fragments (in
  XML) as a resource. Previously, it was only possible to include a
  file by specifying a path to a file or a URL.  This feature was
  requested by Michael Newcomb in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=89">bug 89</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed caller data extraction problem as reported in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=78">bug 78</a> by Hans
  van der Meer.
  </p>

  <p>The LoggingEvent class' constructor now correctly takes into
  account the argument array passed by the user. This problem was
  reported in <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=85">bug
  85</a> by Robert Christian.

  <h3>29th of May 2007 - Release of version 0.9.7</h3>


  <p>This release corrects packaging bugs <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=75">75</a> and <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=76">76</a> related to
  the migration of logback to SLF4J version 1.4.0. There are no other
  changes.
  </p>


  <hr width="80%" align="center" />

  <h3>23rd of May 2007 - Release of version 0.9.6</h3>


  <p>Logback is now aligned and compatible with SLF4J version 1.4.0,
  thus correcting <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=73">bug 73</a> as
  reported by Andy Gerweck.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> problem when running
  under JDK 1.4 <a
  href="http://www.qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2007-April/000206.html">as
  reported</a> by Brian Suksomwong.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=63">bug
  63</a> as reported by La Canea Rosario. Calling log4j (bridge) with
  the trace level will no longer cause an IllegalStateException to be
  thrown.
  </p>

  <p>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=70">bug
  70</a> as reported by Dirk Ooms. The %throwable conversion word is
  now recognized as documented in the logback manual. Moreover, the
  manual now mentions the %nopex word which can be used to force
  <code>PatternLayout</code> to ignore the exception contained in the
  logging request.
  </p>

  
  <p>As in most releases, the documentation has been improved.</p>

  <hr width="80%" align="center" />


  <h3>April 2nd, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.5</h3>

  <p>Fixed methods <code>isInfoEnabled</code>,
  <code>isWarnEnabled</code> and <code>isErrorEnabled</code> methods
  in <code>ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger</code> class which failed to
  work correctly. This bug was reported today by Pavel Kral on the
  slf4j-user list. 
  </p>

  <p>Contrary to previous versions of logback, the various
  Logger.isXYZEnabled(Marker) methods now take into account the marker
  information passed as parameter.
  </p>


  <p>As discussed in <a
  href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=54">bug 54</a>, during
  automatic initialization, it makes better sense to first check for
  <em>logback-test.xml</em> file and only if that fails, to check for
  <em>logback.xml</em>. Maven2 will guarantee that the
  logback-test.xml file, if places undder test/resources will not be
  included in the artifact it produces.
  </p>


  <hr width="80%" align="center" />
  
  <h3>March 29th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.4</h3>
    
  <p>Significant bug fixes made to <code>c.q.l.access.TeeFilter</code>
  and Co. Images and other binary files are now intercepted and
  replayed correctly. As for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests,
  their input buffer is left untouched. In a best-effort attempt, the
  input buffer for "x-www-form-urlencoded" post requests is later
  reconstructed through the request parameters. However, it may differ
  from the original buffer.
  </p>
    
  <p>The logback team released today the first version of a plugin for
  Eclipse that allows developpers to visualize logs generated by a
  running application.  It offers several nice features. Please check
  the <a href="consolePlugin.html">console plugin-in guide</a> for
  more details.
  </p>


  <h3>March 20th, 2007 - Release of version 0.9.3</h3>
  
  <p>Includes in configuration files are now supported by Joran,
  logback's configuration framework. A file can contain an
  <em>include</em> element that has a <em>file</em> or <em>url</em>
  attribute pointing to a configuration file.  See the <a
  href="manual/configuration.html#Include">chapter about
  configuration</a> in the logback's online manual for more
  information.
  </p>
    
  <p>Corrected bug 53 reported by Wilkins Poe. There is now a <a
  href="dependencies.html">dependencies page</a> that shows the
  requirements of each of logback's modules.
  </p>
    
  <p>After a <a
  href="http://www.slf4j.org/pipermail/user/2007-March/000297.html">
  discussion on the SLF4J mailing list</a> started by Franck Routier,
  a correction has been made when logging using the
  <em>JCL104-over-slf4j</em> module. Logback now correctly shows the
  caller location information.
  </p>
    
  <p>As in most logback releases, the documentation has been improved.

  1.2.</p>
  
  <p>Numerous improvements to the documentation.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=46">Bug #46</a>
  reported by Mark Renyolds has been fixed. The
  <code>TimeUtilTest</code> should now run fine under any time
  zone.</p>
		
  <p><a href="http://bugzilla.qos.ch/show_bug.cgi?id=45">Bug
  #45</a>, also reported by Mark Reynolds, has been fixed. There
  should be no <code>ClassCastException</code> thrown anymore when

  <h3>January 31st, 2007 - Release of version 0.9</h3>
  
  <p>This version contains a new component, namely the
  <code>ContextSelector</code>, that provides context separation and
  management when logback is used by several web-apps running under
  the same server. A <a href="manual/contextSelector.html">new
  chapter</a> was added to the logback manual to detail the use of the
  <code>ContextSelector</code>, along with its associated components.
