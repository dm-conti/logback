          <p>Jean-Noel Charpin has been designing and developing object
					oriented software and decision making systems since 1998. He
					is particularly interested in translating lean manufacturing
					principles and practices to the software development domain
					in order to improve quality and reliability.
          </p>

				<td>
          <p>Ceki G&#252;lc&#252; has been working on logging systems
          since 1996.  He is the founder of the log4j, slf4j and
          logback projects.  Ceki enjoys writing software, a task far
          more difficult and time-consuming than what it seems at
          first sight.  His interests range from cryptography, system
          monitoring and testing to application interoperability.
          </p>

				<td>
					<p>S&#233;bastien Pennec has been using computers for the most
					part of his life, be it as a hobby, or during his studies
					or, more recently, as Software Engineer. He loves to write
					software in dynamic and enthusiastic environments, while
					learning new technologies and practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						S&#233;bastien's hobbys include writing articles about
						Macintosh products on <a href="http://www.cuk.ch">cuk.ch</a>,
